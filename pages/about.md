# **About Me**

Hi, I'm Rajiv.

I'm a Security Engineer focused on building security systems that scale. Most of my work is in application security, authorization, and security tooling. I care about making security seamless so engineering teams can move fast without compromising safety.

I'm interested in the security challenges that come with AI systems. How do you protect models from extraction? How do you enforce access control when the attack surface is a natural language interface? How do you build authorization systems that can adapt to new threat patterns in real time? These are the kinds of problems I like thinking about.

As systems become more agentic, security gets more interesting. Agents that can take actions, call APIs, and operate autonomously break a lot of assumptions baked into traditional security models. Identity, authorization, and trust all need to be rethought when the entity making requests is an agent acting on behalf of a user rather than the user themselves. I think the companies that figure out how to give agents real capabilities while maintaining strong security boundaries will define the next era of software.

I've spent a lot of time building automated security controls, from dynamic authorization systems to API security testing frameworks. I enjoy designing systems where security decisions happen automatically based on risk signals rather than static rules.

I like thinking through system design from a security perspective and figuring out how to make things both secure and practical. Lately I've been enjoying vibecoding and using it to spin up tooling faster.

Outside of work, I play a lot of blitz chess online. Currently around 2100 on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/rcwizard12) if you want to play.

# **About Me**

Hi, I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**.

I'm a Security Engineer focused on building and breaking secure systems. My work involves vulnerability research, security architecture, and developing tools to help organizations defend against threats.

When I'm not working on security, you'll find me playing chess. Feel free to challenge me on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/rcwizard12).

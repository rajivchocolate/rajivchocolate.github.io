# **About Me**

Hi, I'm Rajiv.

I'm a Security Engineer with a focus on application security, IAM, and building security tooling. I've built tools for quick prototyping and for systems at massive scale. I enjoy working on problems at the intersection of security and developer experience—making it easier for teams to build secure software without slowing them down.

I like thinking through system design from a security perspective and figuring out how to make things both secure and practical. Lately I've been enjoying vibecoding and using it to spin up tooling faster.

Outside of work, I play a lot of blitz chess online—currently around 2100 on [Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/member/rcwizard12) if you want to play.
